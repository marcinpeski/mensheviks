The IHRA definition played a minor role in the Council discussions in 2020-21, but it played a surprisingly large role in the presidential campaign of 2022 between T. Zoric and R. Levine.

Here is an excerpt from the email sent by one of the supporters of T. Zoric campaign (VP SBWP and the second officer in UTFA) to the School of Engineering. The excerpt, like most of the email, is a negative message about the challenger, R. Levine:

>He joined council around the time that there was a dispute about whether UTFA should endorse the IHRA definition of anti-semitism. A majority of council voted not to endorse this definition (and Meric Gertler took a similar position), and since that time, things related to this (the law school controversy, the CAUT censure, and the process of decision making around these issues) have taken up an enormous amount of council discussion. In the end, UTFA Council has taken some positions on these and other issues that do not satisfy a small group of council members. As a result, this group, with the other candidate as one of their leaders, has turned to tactics that obstruct the functioning of both UTFA Council and UTFA Committees on practically everything else. (Jun Nogami, March 24, 2022)

This email, together with <a href="{% post_url 2022-04-01-Jewish-Faculty %}">the Jewish Faculty letter</a>, creates an impression that Renan Levine’s campaign was motivated by personal issues rather than his publicly stated vision of UTFA. This email joined multiple signals about rumors spread that he is running because of him being upset about the UTFA handling the censure. 

This is false. See the detailed description of the IHRA issue and its relation, or more precisely, the lack of any relation to Renan's campaign, <a href="{% post_url 2022-04-01-Jewish-Faculty %}">here</a>.

On the same day, Jun Nogami issued the following (partial) correction 

>The error is that I said that UTFA Council voted not to endorse the IHRA definition of Anti-Semitism. What happened was that an Executive motion on the subject was tabled by Council on March 23, 2022. … In addition, it has been pointed out to me that the other candidate and many of his followers do not in fact support the IHRA definition of Anti-Semitism, and that I should not imply that this issue was a primary motivating factor for those I refer to as a small group of UTFA Council members that oppose much of the work of the UTFA executive.  I regret that the above paragraph may have given that impression.

The correction does not fully address the problems with the original email.   

* “*I should not imply that this issue was a primary motivating factor.*“ As one of the Renan Levine close campaign supporters, I can attest that the issue was not a factor at all (see also the discussion of IHRA issue above), not just “a primary motivating factor”. See above.  

* “*Enormous amount of council discussion*”: Council spent a very limited amount of time on IHRA definition, and it was mostly in the discussion of the Executive Motion on March 23, 2021. The motion was tabled. Jun Nogami, Terezia Zoric, Renan Levine, and all but one person on the Council voted for tabling it. 

* Council spent quite a bit of time on issues related to the law school controversy, but the discussion was not about the controversy, but about UTFA governance, and specifically, whether association grievances should be approved by the Council, or is President the sole party to decide whether or not to submit them. See <a href="{% post_url 2022-04-01-Jewish-Faculty %}">Association grievances</a>.

* Council had almost no discussion of the CAUT censure. There was information about it coming from the President, but there was no discussion of UTFA position. There was never a vote and Council has not taken any position on the censure. 

* “*Obstruct the functioning of both UTFA Council and UTFA Committees*”. I have no idea what Jun Nogami means. Which Committees were obstructed?
What exactly was the obstruction of the UTFA Council? The only time that the “small group of UTFA Council members” could be seen as obstructing anything was in October 2021, where me and my colleagues attempted to convince the UTFA Council to adopt honest and truthful minutes from the May 18, 2021 Council meeting. The “tactics” used were: (a) a motion to modify the minutes, which was ruled out of order by the chair, which was followed by (b) a motion to challenge the chair, which failed. This entire matter was resolved in 10 min.
