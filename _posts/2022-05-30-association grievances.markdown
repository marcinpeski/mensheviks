The decision of whether or not to submit UTFA association grievances is made by a small leadership, disregarding the UTFA Bylaws that give the Council the right and responsibility to approve all Association goals and positions. The Council is not informed about submission of grievances, and it is not given an opportunity to provide a meaningful feedback.

## Association grievances

An association grievance is one of three types of grievances that can be pursued by the association. The two other are individual and group grievances where UTFA represents a single member or a group of named members. The decision whether to pursue individual and group grievances is administrative and it balances the duty of fair representation that UTFA owes to its members with an expert evaluation of the chances of successful grievance. 

An association grievance is different. 

* It concerns all members of the association. The <a href="https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/UTFA-MoA-2016.pdf">Memorandum of Agreement</a> (article 7) says

>An Association grievance is any complaint by the Association that any of the undertakings or provisions
in this Agreement that directly relate to the Association as such has been breached.

* It is also processed in a different way than individual or group grievances, with the Joint Committee being involved.

In a way, the association grievance is much more about the association pursuing its goals of defending the rights of faculty and librarians, in a similar way as it bargains for them. 

Example of a recent (successful) association grievance is Discrimination in salaries with respect to sex among tenure-streamed women. Another example is the grievance in the Azarova affair. This grievance was initiated by the group faculty directly involved in hiring Azarova. However, the UTFA grieved that the University has breached its academic freedom (and other policies) and the breach is serious that it affects the entire membership.

From the point of view of the UTFA internal decision making, it is important to remember that grievances are costly, both directly (they are written by expert lawyers, they require quite a bit of research, they are long), and indirectly, as each grievance limits the amount of time and attention that can be devoted to other UTFA goals. 

For this reason, the decision on whether to file the grievance or not, is important and consequential. Should it be a decision of the President? Or should Council be involved?

## Decision process - past practice

Under the leadership of Past President Cynthia Messenger, **every association grievance was submitted to the Council for the <i>"approval in principle"</i>**. Not all "approved" grievances were submitted - the Past President, in consultation with other members of Executive made a decision whether to   

This practice was apparently not uniform in the past. We are told that George Luste asked the Council for the approval of association grievances, but Scott Prudham did not.  

On Nov 20, *two days* after the most recent Council meeting, T. Zoric (the President) sent the following message:
>I am writing to let you know that UTFA has now filed an Association grievance on the Faculty of Law Hiring Controversy. ...  
>Note that the issues at stake are so serious that if UTFA were not to grieve, our inaction would be interpreted as consent to deeply flawed processes.

She followed by explaining that UTFA had no choice but to submit the grievance: 
>As you might know, UTFA’s practice has often been to seek approval for Association grievances with Council before moving them forward formally with the Administration. However, this cannot always be the case. For example, and as I’m sure you can understand, where matters of human rights are concerned, the Association’s decision to pursue a grievance cannot be subject to the approval of Council. The Association has an obligation under the Human Rights Code to represent its members in a non-discriminatory manner, and that may include—in some cases—an obligation to bring forward a claim of discrimination (even if unpopular).

This led to controversy: 

* Should not the President ask the Council for approval? Who decides whether UTFA *"*"has an obligation" to submit a grievance?

* Should she inform the Council about working on such a grievance *before* it is submitted? 

To resolve the controversy, and to clarify the process in January 2021, the Council created Grievance Protocol Working Group. This group's report made 4 recommendations: 

* 

The minority report recommended to replace recommendation 4 by ???

## Decision process - rules

UTFA Bylaw 12.2 says

>Council shall normally approve Association positions, goals and objectives of all matters applicable to the membership concerning: salary, benefits, pensions and workload, appointments, and conditions of employment requiring negotiation with the University of Toronto Administration.

This is the only UTFA body tasked with formulating UTFA goals. For example, <a href="https://www.utfa.org/content/utfa-bylaws">the Bylaws</a> describe the role of the President as *responsible for representing the Association's views* (3.1) or *responsible for articulating the philosophy and policies that are promoted through the statements and actions of the Association* (3.2). 

Following the Grievance Protocol Working Group,
