There is a complaint filed against T. Zoric in the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. 
<!--more-->
 
Following the "entitled poerful Zionist minority" comments by T. Zoric, a group of Jewish faculty filed a complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Tributnal alleging discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity and religious beliefs. The complaint is described in [B’nai Brith article](https://www.bnaibrith.ca/human-rights-complaint-launched-against-utfa-president/) about the existence of a Huma complaint. 

After the existence of this complaint was brought up on Council email list (by me!), T. Zoric sent the following message :

> To the Registrar of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario:

> Over the past few months B’nai Brith has repeatedly posted assertions on their website that human rights complaints had been filed against me, although I was not in receipt of any direct correspondence related to a complaint or complaints. More recently I learned that there is a significant backlog at the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and it would likely be months before any complaints would be processed in even a preliminary fashion.

> Understandably, such allegations are distressing, and I am eager to set the record straight as soon as possible.

> Therefore, I wrote to B’nai Brith and the lawyer they cited to ask that I be provided with a copy of the complaints to which they had repeatedly referred on their website. On March 8th I was provided with the complaint applications filed by Professor Florence (dated 12/11/2021) and 7 others dated the same day or very shortly thereafter. **These complaints appear to be rooted in UTFA’s refusal to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. Notably UofT’s own Anti-Semitism Working Group also decided against adopting the IHRA definition.**

> All the complainants request the same set of “Important Documents,” namely “all records, notes and correspondence relating to request by Professor Louis Florence for UTFA to adopt the IHRA definition of anti- semetism [sic]”. No other UTFA or non-UTFA documents are requested of me.

> All the complaints seek the same political remedy.

> Each of the complainants set out the same allegations using precisely the same language and demanding the same sole remedy: my resignation as President of UTFA. This remedy is something the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to order. In contrast, UTFA’s constitution provides a clear procedure for the removal of a president. The effect of this complaint seems to be to inhibit political participation and circumvent the democratic process as set out in UTFA’s Constitution and Bylaws.

> I have now had the opportunity to seek expert legal advice. The complaints have not cleared the first hurdle of meeting the minimum criteria of a code violation, nor will they. Due to the vexatious nature of these complaints and the blatant misrepresentation of facts upon which they are based, I have been informed that an early dismissal by the Human Rights Tribunal on their lack of merit may be anticipated.

> Please be advised that a request for an early dismissal of these complaints will be filed with the Human Rights Tribunal as soon as is procedurally appropriate. (emphasis added)

One of the authors of the complaint, Louis Florence, replied to the above email on 17 March. 

> ... The applicants agreed to allow our legal counsel to provide a copy of the complaint, in good faith, to the respondent (Terezia Zoric). It should be noted that the complaint is not against UTFA, but rather against Terezia Zoric. To be very clear, the complaint is not at all about the IHRA definition discussion at UTFA, nor about UTFA's decision not to recommend that the University of Toronto adopt it. **The complaint ... is about the impact on a group of Jewish University of Toronto faculty, the applicants to the complaint, who felt and feel that Terezia's Zoom comments on June 15, 2021, in her role as the president of UTFA were anti-Semitic, and furthermore  imperilled their right as members of UTFA to be fairly represented by UTFA in future**. This belief was so strong that several members decided that their only recourse was to withdraw from UTFA and have their dues redirected to charity, as the UTFA bylaws allow, thereby depriving themselves of all the benefits that UTFA makes available to its members. (emphasis added)

This led to another, last one, reply by T. Zoric:

> Thanks to all who have written such kind messages of support. Because I do not find the communication below to be accurate, reasonable, warranted, or in good faith, I will not be replying to it here. (17 March 2021)
