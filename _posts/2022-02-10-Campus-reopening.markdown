UTFA advocacy on Covid does not follow the required governance steps.

> UTFA’s Central Health and Safety Committee …  established, with **Council’s explicit endorsement**, the Checklist on Safe University Reopening as UTFA’s position on what it would take to have a safe enough return to in-person work. ” Sep. 26, 2021 (emph orig.) 

> Jun and I have been communicating with the Administration and I with the media in a manner that aligns PERFECTLY with Council motions. … **Marcin: the health and safety positions Jun and I have taken have always been consistent with the governance of UTFA Council**. Feb 4, 2022 (emph orig.) 

Over the course of 2021, UTFA advocated for a particular form of re-opening of the campus: UTFA wanted the UofT to follow 2m social distancing measures.  These positions were publicly stated in the so-called UTFA Checklist (July-August 2021), an open letter (31 August), and a petition (Sep 24). The question is whether adopting these positions followed the regular UTFA governance process, or, as I have suggested in my Council communication, it did not. 

UTFA Governance places the decision making role on the Council. 

> > UTFA Bylaw 12.2 “Council shall normally approve Association positions, goals and objectives of all matters applicable to the membership concerning: salary, benefits, pensions and workload, appointments, and conditions of employment requiring negotiation with the University of Toronto Administration.”

The President is described as a spokeperson, who is responsible for 

> UTFA Bylaw 12.1 ... representing the Association's views to the people of Ontario, the governing bodies of the province, the University of Toronto Administration, appropriate labour and professional agencies, and the media on behalf of the Association,

and

> UTFA Bylaw 3.2 “ ...  articulating the philosophy and policies that are promoted through the statements and actions of the Association. This responsibility includes the interpretation of Association positions on issues that affect the entire Association and its relations with other agencies within and beyond the University.”



> UTFA Bylaw 2.3 “The Executive Committee is charged with carrying out the responsibilities of the Association, as formulated by Council, under the leadership of the President …”


Throughout the entire pandemic, since Jan 2020, the Council has had three(!) Covid-related votes:

* August 8, 2021 - the ratification of [Covid LOU](https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/UTFA-COVID-LOU-Extension-MoS-2022-02-24.pdf),

* August 16, 2021 - endorsement of vaccine mandate,

* December 14, 2021 - campus reopening position.

None of the following has every been approved by the Council:

* The COVID LOU bargaining goals, 

* [the UTFA Checklist](TBA) July-August 2021, 

* [the open letter](TBA) from August 31, 

* [the petition](https://www.utfa.org/content/petition-calling-safe-university-toronto-re-opening) from September 24. 

As far as I can see from the Executive minutes distributed to the Council, none of them were ever approved by the Executive vote as well.
