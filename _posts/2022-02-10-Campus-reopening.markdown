UTFA advocacy on Covid is controversial. Among others, because it does not follow proper governance steps.

> UTFA’s Central Health and Safety Committee …  established, with **Council’s explicit endorsement**, the Checklist on Safe University Reopening as UTFA’s position on what it would take to have a safe enough return to in-person work. ” Sep. 26, 2021 (emph orig.) 

> Jun and I have been communicating with the Administration and I with the media in a manner that aligns PERFECTLY with Council motions. … **Marcin: the health and safety positions Jun and I have taken have always been consistent with the governance of UTFA Council**. Feb 4, 2022 (emph orig.) 

Starting from summer of 2021, UTFA proposed a list of conditions for "safe re-opening". Among them, UTFA wanted the UofT to follow 50% capacity and 2m social distancing measures.  These positions were publicly stated in the so-called UTFA Checklist (July-August 2021), an open letter (31 August), and a petition (Sep 24). 

These positions were controversial for a number of reasons.

* The most important is that enforcing 2m social distancing is equivalent to shutting down the campus. [Simple calcuations]() show that the UofT spaces can house at most courses for 10-15% students under social distancing rules. Because the university will not stay open for 10-15% students (there are overhead costs of keeping the university open, students would not show up for 1 class a wekk, etc), the campus would shut down.

* UTFA positions were not driven by any survey of what faculty wants. The first and only survey of re-opening preferences was done in November, a half of year after UTFA started to advocate for social distancing measures. 

* Early September, Jun Nogami run a snap poll of School of Engineering faculty, which showed an equal split between (a) teaching and exams in-person, (b) teaching online, exams in-person, (c) teaching and exams online. Option (b) is arguably aspirational, and most hated by students. 

* A similar poll done by me in Economics showed an equal split between (a) teaching and exams in-person, and (b) teaching and exams online. 

* Finally, the adoption of this advocacy was not authorized by the Council. 

To explain the latter point, notice that UTFA Bylaws equip the Council with the decision making responsibility. 

> UTFA Bylaw 12.2 “Council shall normally approve Association positions, goals and objectives of all matters applicable to the membership concerning: salary, benefits, pensions and workload, appointments, and conditions of employment requiring negotiation with the University of Toronto Administration.”

The President is described as a spokeperson, who is responsible for 

> UTFA Bylaw 12.1 ... representing the Association's views to the people of Ontario, the governing bodies of the province, the University of Toronto Administration, appropriate labour and professional agencies, and the media on behalf of the Association,

and

> UTFA Bylaw 3.2 “ ...  articulating the philosophy and policies that are promoted through the statements and actions of the Association. This responsibility includes the interpretation of Association positions on issues that affect the entire Association and its relations with other agencies within and beyond the University.”

The Executive Committee, led by the President, is

> UTFA Bylaw 2.3 “... charged with carrying out the responsibilities of the Association, as formulated by Council, under the leadership of the President …”

Throughout the entire pandemic, since Jan 2020, the Council has had three(!) Covid-related votes:

* August 8, 2021 - the ratification of [Covid LOU](https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/UTFA-COVID-LOU-Extension-MoS-2022-02-24.pdf),

* August 16, 2021 - endorsement of vaccine mandate,

* December 14, 2021 - campus reopening position. The position says: 

In particular, before December 14, 2021, the Council was never asked to approve the demand for social distancing measures. It had never an opportunity to debate those measures. An attempt to debate the consequence of those measures through the Council email list was criticized. 

To be completely clear, none of the following has every been approved by the Council:

* The COVID LOU bargaining goals, 

* [the UTFA Checklist](TBA) July-August 2021 - despite the President's claim listed above, the Checklist was never endorsed by the Council, 

* [the open letter](TBA) from August 31, 

* [the petition](https://www.utfa.org/content/petition-calling-safe-university-toronto-re-opening) from September 24. 

As far as I can see from the Executive minutes distributed to the Council, none of them were ever approved by the Executive vote as well.
