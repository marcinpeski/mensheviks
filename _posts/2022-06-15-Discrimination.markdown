UTFA adopts an [anti-discrimination and harassment policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link files/docs/discrimination.pdf %}).
<!--more-->

> Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to membership in any trade union, trade or occupational association or self-governing profession without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ontario-human-rights-code">Ontario Human Rights Code</a>

The Code requires the associations to develop procedures to facilitate intake and investigation of human rights complaints. Somehow surprisingly for an allegedly an organization that wants to see itself progressive, UTFA had no procedure like this. (The equivalent UofT policies are contained in so-called <a href="https://hrandequity.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2016/09/Human-Resources-Guideline-on-Workplace-Harassment-and-Civil-Conduct-Civ....pdf">Civility</a> and <a href="https://hrandequity.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2016/09/Guideline-for-Employees-on-Concerns-and-Complaints-Regarding-Prohibited-....pdf">Discrimination</a> Guidelines.)

Some highlights:

* The policy protects members from the discrimination on the grounds listed in the OHRC, but also from harassment, including sexual, psychological, and personal harassment. The latter is an added benefit (OHRC protections for trade unions and vocational associations do not cover harassment.)

* Importantly, the policy does not prohibit discrimination and harassment on grounds of political beliefs or affiliations. This was controversial because Article 9 of <a href="https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/UTFA-MoA-2016.pdf">the Memorandum of Agreement</a> between UTFA and the UofT includes political beliefs as one of the prohibited grounds in the situation of employment. (Political beliefs belong to protected grounds in most of Canadian provinces - Ontario is one of the few exceptions.) It is unfortunate that the UTFA policy is narrower. (See also [Who are the entitled, powerful Zionists?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-04-01-Jewish-Faculty.markdown %}) for one of the elements of the context.) 

* The policy has a quite extensive catalogue of "inappropriate" complaints: trivial, frivolous, vexatious, and bad-faith. It makes an impression that "inappropriate" complaints are anticipated.  

* The policy covers UTFA members in all interactions that result from UTFA activity. The policy does not extend to UTFA staff. This is unfortunate because (a) for an average member, most of the interactions with UTFA involves UTFA staff (lawyers, grievance or pension specialists) and (b) as for now, UTFA staff has no analogous policy for themselves.   

* All decisions are to be made by a Complaint Review Panel, which consists of 5 members of the Executive. It is a fairly large body, but it is an improvement over the [[original proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link files/docs/discrimination_original.pdf %}) where all decisions about individual harassment or discrimination cases would be made by 14 member Executive making decisions.

* The policy specifically allows a person named in the complaint and a member of the GRP not to recuse themselves from decision-making. 

> The fact that someone has been named in a Complaint does not automatically create a conflict of interest such that they cannot participate in decision-making
regarding the Complaint. It is only where the member cannot act impartially that they will need to be excluded from decision-making. A conflict of interest is
substantiated when a threshold analysis concludes that the identified individual cannot act impartially in the decision-making process.

* Both complainant and respondent are required to sign a confidentiality agreement. The scope of the agreement is not described by the policy.

* The policy is to be reviewed every three years.
