UTFA leaders gave the Council 2h to read the agreement before voting on it. That's not enough; it is also different from the past practice, where the agreement would be released to all faculty and librarians **2 weeks** before the ratification vote.

The new collective agreement was voted on by the Council in very unusual circumstances. The Council had 2h to read <a href="https://www.utfa.org/sites/default/files/SBPW-MOS-UofT-01-24-2022.pdf">15 pages</a> of a tight legal text. More precisely, the announcement of the new agreement was sent to the Council with the following message:

>The Zoom meeting link will open at 3:30 pm at which point a link to the full text of the agreement will be put in the chat. … This is patterned after past practice where copies of the agreement would be passed out to Council during the ratification meeting and then collected at the end of the meeting.” Jun Nogami and Terezia Zoric, Jan 27, 2022.

Later, after the protest of one of us, Jun Nogami (VP SWBP) released the agreement 2h before the meeting. 

There are two questions. 

**Is it a standard practice?**

The answer is no, not even close. In fact, every single agreement between 2011 and 2020 has been fully released **two weeks** before the ratification vote to the **entire UTFA membership**, not only to the Council members. (We do not know what happened before 2011, because this is how far our collective institutional memory - our email boxes - reach.)

Two weeks is long enough to allow the Council members to carefully read the agreement. In principle, two weeks is long enough for the faculty and librarians to rally in opposition to the agreement and stop it from being ratified. 

In 2020-2022 bargaining periods, with the new President and the new bargaining VP, the only other agreement, COVID LOU has been released to the Council four days before the ratification. Although it is worse than in the past, four days is definitely longer than 30 min. 

It is not clear what prompted the misinformation in the above letter. 

**Does the secrecy make any sense?** 

Sure, if you don't want the Council members to read it before the vote. Or, if you want to control how the agreement is presented. 

Half an hour, or even two hours is not enough time to read the agreement, or talk to your fellow colleagues. I can bet that no Council member was able to read it before the ratification meeting. All the information about it came from the meeting and the presentation by the President and the VP SPBW, as well as answering questions of the Council members.

One of the most contentious issues of the future presidential campaign, the question of leaving <a href="{% post_url 2022-04-07-Retiree-benefits %}">retiree benefits</a> for the arbitration, has not been mentioned.
